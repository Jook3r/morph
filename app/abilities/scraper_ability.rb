  # This models which scrapers can be accessed and what can be done. We're generally
  # trying to follow what Github does so that there are the least surprises for users.
  #
  # With just public scrapers everyone can view them but you have to be either the
  # owner of the scraper or a member of an organization which owns the scraper to be
  # able to modify and run the scraper. This isn't what Github does exactly but has
  # been close enough not to cause too much confusion.
  #
  # With private scrapers it becomes much more important to more faithfully follow
  # the complex model that Github uses.
  #
  # For compatibility (in the short term) we are going to maintain the current
  # model for public scrapers but use a new more fine-grained approach for
  # private scrapers.
  #
  # TODO: Move over to using the same fine-grained approach for everyone
