- title "Scraping JavaScript heavy sites"
:markdown
  ## #{title}

  In most circumstances web scraping is done by downloading a web page using your programming language and a library.
  However in some cases you need to simulate a web browser.
  This could be because the web site is poorly programmed or because it makes extensive use of JavaScript.

  You can do this by using a headless browser. On morph.io there are two different headless browsers
  pre-installed ready for you to use, [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).
  We recommend using Google Chrome as PhantomJS is now deprecated. However, you will notice the
  documentation below for using Google Chrome from different scraping languages is pretty non-existent.
  If you would like to contribute to the documentation that would be amazing!

%h3 Using Chrome Headless
:markdown
  The Google Chrome binary is installed at `/usr/bin/google-chrome` on every morph.io container
  as [part of the build process](https://github.com/openaustralia/buildstep/blob/master/Dockerfile).
  You can use Google Chrome directly by running it with `google-chrome --headless --disable-gpu` or
  you can control it via WebDriver with [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)
  which is installed on morph.io at `/usr/local/bin/chromedriver`.

%h4 Usage
= render "language_tabs", id_prefix: "using_chrome_headless", path: "documentation/chrome_headless"

%h3 Using PhantomJS (deprecated)
:markdown
  You can control PhantomJS from your scraper using JavaScript or a wrapper library.
  The PhantomJS binary, `/usr/bin/phantomjs`, is installed on morph.io as part of the `phantomjs` Ubuntu package, which is installed in every scraper container as [part of the build process](https://github.com/openaustralia/buildstep/blob/master/Dockerfile).
  On your own machine, youâ€™ll need to [download and install the binary](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) yourself before you can run a scraper using PhantomJS.

%h4 Usage
= render "language_tabs", id_prefix: "using_phantomjs", path: "documentation/phantomjs"
